Snowflake Data Test Templates

A practical collection of Snowflake SQL and Snowpark patterns used for technical interviews, prototyping, and rapid data testing.

This repository contains reusable snippets for:

Random data generation

Common SQL interview problems

Window functions and analytics

Data loading patterns (INSERT, MERGE, COPY)

Data quality checks

Performance and troubleshooting examples

Optional Snowpark Python templates

The goal is to have a lightweight toolkit that can be executed quickly inside Snowflake Worksheets or Snowflake Notebooks.
